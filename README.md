# Animated Landing Page

## Description

Build a website for a local organization.

Find an organization in your local community that has a website. It could be a business, a non-profit, a sports team, a community center, or something else in that vein.

This will be your source of content. Then, design and build a new site for the organization. You can use the same content (text and images) to populate the site, but come up with a different design.

If the site you pick has more than 3 pages, aim to build at least 3 of the most important pages (e.g. "Home", "About", "Contact").
